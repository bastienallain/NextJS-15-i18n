# First Blog Post

Welcome to our first blog post! This content is in English.

## What is this about?

This is a demo post showing how to use Contentlayer with Next.js and next-intl for a multilingual blog.

You can write your content in **Markdown** with all its features, including:
- Lists
- *Italic* and **bold** text
- [Links](https://example.com)
- And much more!

```javascript
// You can even include code blocks
const greeting = 'Hello, world!';
console.log(greeting);
```
